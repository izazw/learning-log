### Today's progress ###
Learn about GitHub gists today. Gists are just a simple way to share code snippets and entire files. They work as repositories and can be cloned or forked by other people (if set to public).  [https://gist.github.com/]. I used gist to add the Totoro gif. [Check it out here:](https://gist.github.com/izazw/91d94f1a0fcf047e85ef9c75733fd09f)

### Today's progress ###
* Inspired by [Katie Hawcutt 100 Days Of Code Diary](https://github.com/katiehawcutt/100DaysOfCode) I decided to keep track of my learning :-)

### Thoughts ###
I hope that this log will help me to embrace the fact that learning is a continuous process, celebrate small victories, and view challenges as opportunities for growth. I treat is a reminder that the journey matters as much as the destination!
