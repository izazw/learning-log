# Learning log

## 1 ##
*10th August* 

### Today's progress ###
* Inspired by [Katie Hawcutt 100 Days Of Code Diary](https://github.com/katiehawcutt/100DaysOfCode) I decided to keep track of my learning :-)

### Thoughts ###
I hope that this log will help me to embrace the fact that learning is a continuous process, celebrate small victories, and view challenges as opportunities for growth. I treat is a reminder that the journey matters as much as the destination.
