### Today's progress ###
Spent some time manipulating arrays and transforming strings. 

* came across unary plus (+). 

### Thoughts ###

As part of my post-Bootcamp coding routine, I coorganize pair programming sessions. I primarily concentrate on JavaScript, considering it a solid foundation for my ongoing learning. I found pair programming particularly useful in boosting confidence to learn, code, and solve problems in public, fostering open communication. It brings a lot of enjoyment from puzzle-solving too! Good to see how it steadily enhances my grasp of JavaScript.

### Today's progress ###
Learn about GitHub gists today. Gists are just a simple way to share code snippets and entire files. They work as repositories and can be cloned or forked by other people (if set to public).  [https://gist.github.com/]. I used gist to add the Totoro gif. [Check it out here.](https://gist.github.com/izazw/91d94f1a0fcf047e85ef9c75733fd09f)


### Thoughts ###
Came back after camping holidays (explored Quebec's fiords and mountains in Grands Jardins) and need to stretch again my coding muscles! I'm updating my portfolio and can't wait to share the results.

### Today's progress ###
* Inspired by [Katie Hawcutt 100 Days Of Code Diary](https://github.com/katiehawcutt/100DaysOfCode) I decided to keep track of my learning :-)

### Thoughts ###
I hope that this log will help me to embrace the fact that learning is a continuous process, celebrate small victories, and view challenges as opportunities for growth. I treat is a reminder that the journey matters as much as the destination!
